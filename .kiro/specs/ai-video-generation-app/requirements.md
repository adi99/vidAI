# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project is a production-grade AI-powered mobile application built with Expo (React Native) and Supabase that enables users to generate, edit, and share AI-generated videos and images. The app features personalized model training using user-uploaded photos, a credit-based system, subscription management, and social features similar to TikTok. The application consists of a mobile frontend with five main tabs (Feed, Video, Image, Training, Profile) and a scalable backend infrastructure supporting GPU-based AI generation, queue management, and real-time notifications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication and Profile Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create an account and manage my profile, so that I can access personalized AI generation features and track my usage.

3. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL display their current credit balance and subscription status
4. WHEN a user accesses their profile THEN the system SHALL show their generated content, credits, and subscription details
5. IF a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL restrict access to generation features

### Requirement 2: AI Video Generation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to generate AI videos using different input methods, so that I can create unique video content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects text-to-video generation THEN the system SHALL accept a text prompt and generate a video
2. WHEN a user selects image-to-video generation THEN the system SHALL accept an image upload and text prompt
3. WHEN a user selects keyframe generation THEN the system SHALL accept first and last frame images
4. WHEN video generation is initiated THEN the system SHALL deduct appropriate credits from user balance
5. WHEN video generation completes THEN the system SHALL notify the user via push notification
6. IF user has insufficient credits THEN the system SHALL prevent generation and prompt for credit purchase

### Requirement 3: AI Image Generation and Editing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to generate and edit AI images with various models and quality settings, so that I can create and refine visual content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates image generation THEN the system SHALL allow model selection and quality settings
2. WHEN a user provides a prompt THEN the system SHALL offer prompt enhancement options
3. WHEN a user wants to edit an image THEN the system SHALL provide masking tools and prompt input
4. WHEN image generation/editing is initiated THEN the system SHALL deduct credits based on selected quality
5. WHEN generation completes THEN the system SHALL save the image and notify the user
6. WHEN a user applies masking THEN the system SHALL only regenerate the masked areas

### Requirement 4: Personalized Model Training

**User Story:** As a user, I want to train a personalized AI model using my photos, so that I can generate content featuring myself or specific subjects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates training THEN the system SHALL require 10-30 photo uploads
2. WHEN photos are uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate image quality and format
3. WHEN training is configured THEN the system SHALL allow step selection (600, 1200, 2000)
4. WHEN training starts THEN the system SHALL deduct credits based on selected steps
5. WHEN training completes THEN the system SHALL make the trained model available for generation
6. WHEN training fails THEN the system SHALL refund credits and notify the user

### Requirement 5: Social Feed and Content Sharing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view and interact with AI-generated content from other users, so that I can discover inspiration and engage with the community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the Feed tab THEN the system SHALL display a scrollable feed of AI-generated videos
2. WHEN a user views content THEN the system SHALL provide like, comment, and share options
3. WHEN a user likes content THEN the system SHALL update the like count immediately
4. WHEN a user shares content THEN the system SHALL provide platform-specific sharing options
5. WHEN a user comments THEN the system SHALL display the comment in real-time
6. WHEN content loads THEN the system SHALL implement infinite scroll for seamless browsing

### Requirement 6: Credit System and In-App Purchases

**User Story:** As a user, I want to purchase and manage credits, so that I can pay for AI generation services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user's credits are low THEN the system SHALL display credit purchase options
2. WHEN a user initiates purchase THEN the system SHALL use Expo IAP for transaction processing
3. WHEN purchase completes THEN the system SHALL add credits to user balance immediately
4. WHEN generation is requested THEN the system SHALL verify sufficient credits before processing
5. WHEN credits are deducted THEN the system SHALL update the balance in real-time
6. IF purchase fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error message and retry options

### Requirement 7: Subscription Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to subscribe to premium plans, so that I can access enhanced features and credit allowances.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views subscription options THEN the system SHALL display available plans and benefits
2. WHEN a user subscribes THEN the system SHALL process payment via Expo IAP
3. WHEN subscription is active THEN the system SHALL provide monthly credit allowances
4. WHEN subscription expires THEN the system SHALL revert to free tier limitations
5. WHEN subscription status changes THEN the system SHALL update user interface accordingly

### Requirement 8: Push Notifications

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive notifications about generation completion and other important events, so that I stay informed about my requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN app is installed THEN the system SHALL request push notification permissions
2. WHEN generation completes THEN the system SHALL send push notification with result
3. WHEN training finishes THEN the system SHALL notify user of completion or failure
4. WHEN credits are low THEN the system SHALL send reminder notifications
5. WHEN user grants permission THEN the system SHALL register push token with backend

### Requirement 9: Backend Queue Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable queue management for AI generation tasks, so that user requests are processed efficiently and reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generation is requested THEN the system SHALL add job to Redis queue
2. WHEN worker is available THEN the system SHALL process jobs in FIFO order
3. WHEN job fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
4. WHEN queue is full THEN the system SHALL provide estimated wait times to users
5. WHEN job completes THEN the system SHALL update database and trigger notifications

### Requirement 10: Scalable Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want horizontally scalable infrastructure, so that the application can handle growing user demand.

#### Acceptance Criteria
